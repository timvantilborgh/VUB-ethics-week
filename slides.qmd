## A personal note: My first year as a PhD student

::: incremental
-   I was (somewhat) trained in statistics and research methods, but not in how I should be managing and organizing a research project
-   I used SPSS and MS Word
-   Rerunning an analysis was a nightmare
-   Copying results from SPSS to MS Word was prone to errors
-   Data files were not documented
-   Folder structures grew organically
-   File naming conventions were non-existent
-   Knowledge about decisions that were made during research project existed solely in my mind

## What is reproducible research?

> Research is reproducible when others can reproduce the results of a scientific study given only the original data, code, and documentation [^1]

[^1]: Alston, J. M., & Rick, J. A. (2021). A beginner's guide to Conducting reproducible research. *Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America, 102*(2), 1-14.

## How does it fit into open science?

> "Open Science" is an umbrella term used to refer to the concepts of openness, transparency, rigour, [reproducibility]{.orange}, replicability, and accumulation of knowledge, which are considered fundamental features of science [^2]

## Reproducability vs Replicability

-   These are not the same!
-   Replicability: Another team uses same method on new data to see if similar conclusions can be drawn
-   Reproducability: Same or another team uses same method on same data to see if they obtain the exact same results

## To what extent is it a problem?

-   Random sample of 250 psychology articles published between 2014 and 2017 [^4]
    -   Research materials availability: 14%
    -   Protocol availability: 0%
    -   Data availability: 2%
    -   Analysis-script availability: 1%

## To what extent is it a problem?

-   232 key statistical claims from 46 published articles tested using the raw data and following the methods section closely [^5]:
    -   70% of claims could be successfully reproduced
    -   7% of claims were no longer statistically significant

## To what extent is it a problem?

-   These problems are not limited to psychology
    -   Economics: problems in 29 out of 67 articles [^6]
    -   Genetics: problems in 10 out of 18 articles [^7]
    -   Political science: problems in 20 out of 24 articles [^8]

## How can we make our research reproducible?

-   Open materials allow us to test reproducability [^9]

![](images/vagueness.png){fig-align="center"}

## How can we make our research reproducible?

-   Share data
-   Share analysis scripts
-   Use and share lab notebooks
-   Write and share dynamic reports that integrate text and analyses

## What are the benefits?

-   Clear log of all steps taken in the research process
-   Easy to update analyses, reuse materials, and save time
-   Signals rigor, transparency, and trustworthiness
-   Increases citation rate
-   Allows others to learn from your work
-   Simplifies follow-up research
-   Prevents mistakes from compounding over time

## So why aren't we all doing this?

## What tools can we use?

-   Rmarkdown
-   Quarto
-   R packages (e.g., worcs, papaja)
-   Repositories (e.g., OSF, Zenodo, Github)
-   Version control (e.g., Github)

## A quick example using papaja

![](images/github.png){fig-align="center"}

## Limitations

-   Collaboration can be difficult when co-authors are not familiar with tools
-   Conversion to pdf works better than conversion to word (Quarto solves this problem)
-   Long-term computational reproducability can be an issue
-   There are situations where a simple word document is easier than an Rmarkdown or Quarto file
-   There is a learning curve

## Conclusions: policy perspective

## Conclusions: personal note

::: incremental
-   Is my workflow ideal and error-proof now that I apply these practices?
-   Is my research reproducible?
-   Personal benefits:
    -   Saving time
    -   Community
    -   My future self is happy with my present self
