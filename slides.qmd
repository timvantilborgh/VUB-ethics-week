::: notes
-   I was (somewhat) trained in statistics and research methods, but not in how I should be managing and organizing a research project
-   I used SPSS and MS Word
-   Rerunning an analysis was a nightmare
-   Copying results from SPSS to MS Word was prone to errors
-   Data files were not documented
-   Folder structures grew organically
-   File naming conventions were non-existent
-   Knowledge about decisions that were made during research project existed solely in my mind

## What is reproducible research?

> Research is reproducible when others can reproduce the results of a scientific study given only the original data, code, and documentation [^1]

[^1]: Alston, J. M., & Rick, J. A. (2021). A beginner's guide to Conducting reproducible research. *Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America, 102*(2), 1-14.

## How does it fit into open science?

> "Open Science" is an umbrella term used to refer to the concepts of openness, transparency, rigour, [reproducibility]{.orange}, replicability, and accumulation of knowledge, which are considered fundamental features of science [^2]

## Reproducability vs Replicability

## To what extent is it a problem?

-   Random sample of 250 psychology articles published between 2014 and 2017 [^3]
    -   Research materials availability: 14%
    -   Protocol availability: 0%
    -   Data availability: 2%
    -   Analysis-script availability: 1%

## To what extent is it a problem?

-   232 key statistical claims from 46 published articles tested using the raw data and following the methods section closely [^4]:
    -   70% of claims could be successfully reproduced
    -   7% of claims were no longer statistically significant

## To what extent is it a problem?

-   These problems are not limited to psychology
    -   Economics: problems in 29 out of 67 articles [^5]
    -   Genetics: problems in 10 out of 18 articles [^6]
    -   Political science: problems in 20 out of 24 articles [^7]

## How can we make our research reproducible?

-   Open materials allow us to test reproducability [^8]

![](images/vagueness.png){fig-align="center"}

## How can we make our research reproducible?

-   Share data
-   Share analysis scripts
-   Use and share lab notebooks
-   Reproducible workflow with [dynamic documents]{.orange}

## Reproducible workflow

:::

## Version control

-   Track changes to files
-   Ability to recall specific versions of files or revert entire project to a past state
-   Tools: GitHub, Gitlab
-   Ability to collaborate and share files

## Dependency management

-   In what sequence should files be executed?
-   Tools: Make, Targets, Drake

## Dynamic document generation

## Dynamic document generation: Papaja

![](images/github.png){fig-align="center"}

## Containerization

-   Software, R packages, operating systems are commonly updated
-   Code may no longer run due to updates
-   Tools: Docker, renv, liftR, holepunch
-   Encapsulate, share, and re-create computational environment
-   Save versions of R packages, R, operating systems, etcetera

## So why aren't we all doing this?

:::

## Limitations

-   Collaboration can be difficult when co-authors are not familiar with tools (redoc package!)
-   Conversion to pdf works better than conversion to word (Quarto solves this problem)
-   There are situations where a simple word document is easier than an Rmarkdown or Quarto file
-   There is a learning curve; we should train people early on in their research career!

## Conclusion
